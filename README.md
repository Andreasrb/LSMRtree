# Faster Insertions in Spatial Databases
This repository contains the code for our LSMR-tree developed during our master thesis under the Departement of Computer Science at NTNU

The central part of this is an LSM R-tree implementation, which is a leveled LSM-tree with R-trees as components, using an experimental merge strategy between the levels.

This Repository was forked from an earlier thesis as a means of taking use of an already imlplemented R-tree.
