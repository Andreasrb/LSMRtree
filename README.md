# Improving Write Performance for Multidimensional Data
This code is the basis for our implementation developed when writing our Master's thesis for the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

Our objective was to improve write performance for multidimensional data by utilizing
bulk-loading and bulk-insertion between LSM-tree levels where the level components consist of R-trees.
